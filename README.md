# elm-workshop

This repository contains some exercises to work with Elm. Some exercises are
an extension of an Elm Architecture tutorial (recommended to do these as well,
see https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/).

## How to run the demo's?
* Use the online editor (Ellie App)[https://ellie-app.com] (recommended). Every
Elm exercise file should have an URL to Ellie. The workshop in Ellie App is the
same as in the file. I added styling in the Ellie App exercises, therefore these
simply look better compared to running the exercises locally.
* If Elm is installed, run `elm-reactor` in the root directory of this project
and go to http://localhost:8000. However, I didn't add styling, therefore it
looks like crap. You can add styling yourself though (and it's a nice exercise!)
